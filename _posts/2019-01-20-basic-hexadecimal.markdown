[Binary language]({% post_url 2018-12-30-basic-binary %}) is used to process and manipulate data in computers, but the binary language has some flows. One of the most important flows is readability.

Hexadecimal uses digits that resemble our basic base-10 counting system (decimal). The second reason is higher information density, with only two digits we can represent numbers to a maximum value of 255, to do the same in binary we need 8 digits.

{% highlight ruby %}
e7 => 1110 0111 = 231
{% endhighlight %}

We as humans use hexadecimal language to represent machine language with more ease. So one would ask why donâ€™t we use the decimal system. The main reason is a collaboration between binary and hexadecimal. We can represent every hexadecimal number as four binary numbers.

| Hexadecimal | Binary         | Decimal value |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 0           | 0000           | 0             |
| 1           | 0001           | 1             |
| 2           | 0010           | 2             |
| 3           | 0011           | 3             |
| 4           | 0100           | 4             |
| 5           | 0101           | 5             |
| 6           | 0110           | 6             |
| 7           | 0111           | 7             |
| 8           | 1000           | 8             |
| 9           | 1001           | 9             |
| A           | 1010           | 10            |
| B           | 1011           | 11            |
| C           | 1100           | 12            |
| D           | 1101           | 13            |
| E           | 1110           | 14            |
| F           | 1111           | 15            |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|

To better comprehend the reasons behind the above statement we need to know that our basic decimal system has a base of 10 supposed to hexadecimal which has a base of 16. So with that in mind, we know that the best ways to compress binary data should have a base that is a multiple of 2.

To better imagine how to convert hexadecimal to decimal, we will take number 231 as an example

| Hexadecimal | Value  | Decimal value |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| e           | 14     | 224           |
| 7           | 7      | 7             |
| Total       |        | 231           |
|-------------|--------|---------------|

We calculate a mathematical representation of above as:

{% highlight ruby %}
e7
=>
14 * 16 ^ 1
+  7 * 16 ^ 0
= 231
{% endhighlight %}
