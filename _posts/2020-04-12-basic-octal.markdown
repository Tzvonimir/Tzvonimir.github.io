Octal number system is a number system with a base 8. Octal number system is used to represent binary data in groups of three.

So lets look at a first 15 numbers in decimal, binary and octal.

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| Decimal | Binary | Octal |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 0       | 0000   | 0     |
| 1       | 0001   | 1     |
| 2       | 0010   | 2     |
| 3       | 0011   | 3     |
| 4       | 0100   | 4     |
| 5       | 0101   | 5     |
| 6       | 0110   | 6     |
| 7       | 0111   | 7     |
| 8       | 1000   | 10    |
| 9       | 1001   | 11    |
| 10      | 1010   | 12    |
| 11      | 1011   | 13    |
| 12      | 1100   | 14    |
| 13      | 1101   | 15    |
| 14      | 1110   | 16    |
| 15      | 1111   | 17    |
|---------|--------|-------|

</div>

So we can see that the greatest number in one octal group is 7, because we represent octal number as three binary numbers.

Letâ€™s check out logic in representing decimal number 15 as an octal number.

{% highlight ruby %}
1111
  => 001 | 111
  =>   1 |   7
  => 17 (base 8)
{% endhighlight %}
